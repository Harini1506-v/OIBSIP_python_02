This project generates strong, secure passwords using user-defined length and character options (letters, numbers, symbols). Built with Python’s random and string modules to strengthen core programming skills.

Password Generator

Oasis Infobyte Internship – Task 2

The Password Generator is a Python-based program developed as part of Task 2 of the Oasis Infobyte Internship. This project aims to generate strong and secure passwords based on user-defined preferences such as password length and character types. The program is designed for beginners to practice essential Python programming concepts, including user input handling, conditional logic, loops, and randomization.

Project Overview

Passwords play a crucial role in protecting personal and professional data. Weak or predictable passwords can lead to security risks. This Password Generator program helps users create random and hard-to-guess passwords by combining letters, numbers, and special characters.

The program prompts the user to select the desired password length and choose whether to include letters, numbers, and symbols. Based on these inputs, the program generates a secure password using Python’s built-in libraries. This project demonstrates how Python can be applied to solve real-world security-related problems while strengthening core programming skills.

Features

The Password Generator includes the following features:

User Input Handling:
The program accepts user input for password length and character selection options.

Custom Password Generation:
Users can customize their passwords by choosing letters, numbers, and special characters.

Random Password Creation:
The program generates passwords using random character selection to ensure unpredictability.

Input Validation:
Ensures that at least one character type is selected, preventing invalid password generation.

Beginner-Friendly Design:
Simple logic and clear structure make the program easy to understand and modify.


Technologies and Concepts Used

Python 3.x: Core programming language

Built-in Modules:

random for random character selection

string for accessing character sets


Conditional Statements: Used to process user choices

Loops: Used to generate passwords of required length

String Manipulation: Used to construct the final password


How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the desired password length.


2. The user selects whether to include letters, numbers, and symbols.


3. A character pool is created based on user selections.


4. The program randomly selects characters from the pool.


5. The generated password is displayed to the user.


Outcome

The Password Generator successfully creates secure and customizable passwords based on user preferences. This project serves as an excellent beginner-level Python application that highlights the importance of cybersecurity fundamentals while reinforcing logical thinking and programming skills.
